/**
 * The Interface StatefulVerbCall.
 * 
 * StatefulVerbCall represents a verb call for a given set of parameter values, a so called stateful verb call (SVC). An application uses 
 * execute() method to execute the SVC object. The execute() returns a call specific type T which can be queried for the result of the operation. 
 * 
 * One key advantage of SVCs is that they can be cached and re-executed many times. Semantically, each execution of an SVC object is identical to a jVerbs call evaluated against the 
 * current parameter state of the SVC object. Any serialization state that is necessary while executing the SVC object, however, will only have to be created 
 * when executing the object for the first time. Subsequent calls use the already established serialization state, and will 
 * therefore execute much faster. Once the SVC object no longer needed, resources can be freed using the free() API call.
 *
 * @param <T> the type of the result of this SVC.
