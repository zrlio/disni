      "message": "Hi Jonas,\nThe traditional way to implement a valueOf(int val) is with switch-case, manually providing all of the values. Although much less elegant than your implementation, this way the overhead is very minimal compared to traversing the list, which implies the creation of interim objects (iterator...) and requires a significantly higher number of iterations. As this function will mostly be used in the data-path CQ processing, I think it will be better to use the traditional method.",

      "message": "Hi Yuval. At the moment this is not used anywhere in the DiSNI codebase itself. I use it in one of my applications for debug purposes as stated. You are right, eventually we want a more efficient solution and replace all the code that returns a int as the status with IbvWcStatus.",
